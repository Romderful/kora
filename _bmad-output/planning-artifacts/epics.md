## Epic 1: Core Schema Registry

A developer can register Avro schemas, retrieve them by ID/subject/version, list subjects, and get a fully Confluent-compatible API experience.

### Story 1.1: Project Scaffold, Database & Health Check

As a **developer**,
I want a running Kora server with PostgreSQL connectivity and a health endpoint,
So that I have the foundation to build all schema registry features on.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a fresh checkout of the repository
**When** I run `cargo build`
**Then** the project compiles with zero warnings under `clippy::pedantic`
**And** `deny(missing_docs)` is enforced at crate level

**Given** a running PostgreSQL instance
**When** Kora starts with `DATABASE_URL` configured
**Then** database migrations run automatically on startup
**And** the `schemas`, `subjects`, `schema_references`, and `config` tables are created

**Given** a running Kora server
**When** I send `GET /health`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with PG connectivity confirmed
**And** if PG is unreachable, I receive HTTP 503

**Given** any API error
**When** the error response is returned
**Then** it follows Confluent format: `{"error_code": <int>, "message": "<string>"}`
**And** `Content-Type` is `application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json`

**FRs:** FR39, FR40, FR41, FR46, FR47, FR48

### Story 1.2: Register Avro Schema

As a **developer**,
I want to register an Avro schema under a subject,
So that my producers and consumers can serialize/deserialize data using a shared schema.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid Avro schema JSON
**When** I send `POST /subjects/{subject}/versions` with `{"schema": "<avro_json>"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"id": <globally_unique_sequential_id>}`
**And** the schema is stored in PostgreSQL with its canonical form

**Given** the same Avro schema is registered again under the same subject
**When** I send `POST /subjects/{subject}/versions`
**Then** I receive the existing schema ID (idempotent — no duplicate version created)

**Given** an invalid Avro schema
**When** I send `POST /subjects/{subject}/versions`
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 with Confluent error code 42201

**Given** a valid schema with `schemaType` omitted
**When** I send `POST /subjects/{subject}/versions`
**Then** the system defaults to Avro (Confluent default behavior)

**FRs:** FR1, FR15, FR49

### Story 1.3: Retrieve Schema by Global ID

As a **developer**,
I want to retrieve a schema by its global ID,
So that my deserializers can resolve schemas from the ID embedded in Kafka messages.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a registered schema with ID 1
**When** I send `GET /schemas/ids/1`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"schema": "<schema_json>"}`

**Given** a non-existent schema ID
**When** I send `GET /schemas/ids/999`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40403

**FRs:** FR2

### Story 1.4: Retrieve Schema by Subject and Version

As a **developer**,
I want to retrieve a schema by subject name and version number (or "latest"),
So that I can inspect specific versions or always get the most recent schema.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** subject "orders-value" with versions 1, 2, 3
**When** I send `GET /subjects/orders-value/versions/2`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"subject": "orders-value", "id": <id>, "version": 2, "schema": "<json>", "schemaType": "AVRO"}`

**When** I send `GET /subjects/orders-value/versions/latest`
**Then** I receive the version 3 schema

**Given** a non-existent subject
**When** I send `GET /subjects/unknown/versions/1`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40401

**Given** a valid subject but non-existent version
**When** I send `GET /subjects/orders-value/versions/99`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40402

**FRs:** FR3, FR4

### Story 1.5: List Subjects and Versions

As a **developer**,
I want to list all subjects and all versions of a subject,
So that I can discover available schemas in the registry.

**FRs:** FR6, FR7

### Story 1.6: Check Schema Registration

As a **developer**,
I want to check if a schema is already registered under a subject,
So that I can verify whether my schema exists without registering a new version.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** subject "orders-value" has a registered schema
**When** I send `POST /subjects/orders-value` with `{"schema": "<matching_schema>"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"subject": "orders-value", "id": <id>, "version": <ver>, "schema": "<json>"}`

**Given** a schema not registered under the subject
**When** I send `POST /subjects/orders-value` with `{"schema": "<unknown_schema>"}`

**FRs:** FR5

### Story 1.7: List Supported Schema Types

As a **developer**,
I want to list the schema types the registry supports,
So that I know which formats I can use.

As a **developer**,
I want to soft-delete a subject or a specific version,
So that I can remove schemas from active use while preserving them for audit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** subject "orders-value" with versions 1, 2, 3
**When** I send `DELETE /subjects/orders-value`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `[1, 2, 3]` (list of soft-deleted versions)
**And** `GET /subjects` no longer includes "orders-value"
**And** `GET /subjects?deleted=true` includes "orders-value"

**Given** subject "orders-value" with versions 1, 2, 3
**When** I send `DELETE /subjects/orders-value/versions/2`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `2`
**And** `GET /subjects/orders-value/versions` returns `[1, 3]`

**Given** a non-existent subject
**When** I send `DELETE /subjects/unknown`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40401

**FRs:** FR8, FR9

### Story 2.2: Hard-Delete Subject and Versions

As a **developer**,
I want to permanently delete a subject or version,
So that I can completely remove schemas that should not exist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a soft-deleted subject "orders-value"
**When** I send `DELETE /subjects/orders-value?permanent=true`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with the list of permanently deleted versions
**And** the schema data is removed from PostgreSQL

**Given** a soft-deleted version 2 of subject "orders-value"
**When** I send `DELETE /subjects/orders-value/versions/2?permanent=true`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `2`

**Given** a subject that is NOT soft-deleted
**When** I send `DELETE /subjects/orders-value?permanent=true`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40401

**FRs:** FR10, FR11

### Story 2.3: Schema ID Cross-References

As a **developer**,
I want to find all subjects and versions that use a given schema ID,
So that I can understand the impact of a schema across the registry.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** schema ID 1 is used by subjects "orders-value" (v1) and "users-value" (v2)
**When** I send `GET /schemas/ids/1/subjects`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `["orders-value", "users-value"]`

**Given** schema ID 1 is registered as version 1 under "orders-value"
**When** I send `GET /schemas/ids/1/versions`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `[{"subject": "orders-value", "version": 1}]`

**Given** a non-existent schema ID
**When** I send `GET /schemas/ids/999/subjects`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40403

**FRs:** FR13, FR14

### Story 2.4: Schema References and Dependency Protection

As a **developer**,
I want schemas to reference other schemas and be protected from deletion when referenced,
So that dependent schemas remain valid.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a schema with `"references": [{"name": "User", "subject": "users-value", "version": 1}]`
**When** I send `POST /subjects/orders-value/versions` with the referencing schema
**Then** the system validates that "users-value" version 1 exists
**And** stores the reference relationship

**Given** a schema registration with a reference to a non-existent subject/version
**When** I send `POST /subjects/orders-value/versions`
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 with an error indicating the referenced schema was not found

**Given** schema "users-value" v1 is referenced by "orders-value" v1
**When** I attempt to hard-delete "users-value" v1
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 indicating the schema is referenced and cannot be deleted

**FRs:** FR18, FR19

## Epic 3: Multi-Format Support

A developer can register JSON Schema and Protobuf schemas with the same workflow as Avro.

**And** the schema is parsed, validated, and stored with its canonical form

**Given** an invalid JSON Schema document
**When** I send `POST /subjects/{subject}/versions` with `{"schemaType": "JSON", "schema": "<invalid>"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 with Confluent error code 42201

**Given** a registered JSON Schema
**When** I retrieve it via `GET /schemas/ids/{id}`
**Then** the response includes `"schemaType": "JSON"`

**FRs:** FR16

I want to register Protobuf schemas,
So that I can use Protobuf for high-performance serialization in my pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid `.proto` definition as a string
**When** I send `POST /subjects/{subject}/versions` with `{"schemaType": "PROTOBUF", "schema": "<proto_def>"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with the assigned schema ID
**And** the schema is parsed, validated, and stored with its canonical form

## Epic 4: Compatibility Checking

A developer can test schema compatibility and configure compatibility modes.

### Story 4.1: Compatibility Configuration CRUD

As a **developer**,
I want to get and set compatibility configuration at global and per-subject levels,
So that I can control how schema evolution is enforced.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a running Kora server with default config
**When** I send `GET /config`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"compatibilityLevel": "BACKWARD"}`

**Given** I want to change the global compatibility

**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"compatibility": "FULL"}`

**Given** subject "orders-value" exists
**When** I send `PUT /config/orders-value` with `{"compatibility": "NONE"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"compatibility": "NONE"}`

**Given** subject "orders-value" has per-subject config
**When** I send `GET /config/orders-value`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"compatibilityLevel": "NONE"}`

**Given** subject "orders-value" has per-subject config
**When** I send `DELETE /config/orders-value`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"compatibility": "BACKWARD"}` (falls back to global)

**FRs:** FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25

### Story 4.2: Compatibility Test Endpoint

As a **developer**,
I want to test if a new schema is compatible with existing versions,
So that I can validate schema changes before registering them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** subject "orders-value" with version 1 and compatibility mode BACKWARD
**When** I send `POST /compatibility/subjects/orders-value/versions/latest` with a backward-compatible schema
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"is_compatible": true}`

**Given** subject "orders-value" with compatibility mode BACKWARD
**When** I send `POST /compatibility/subjects/orders-value/versions/latest` with an incompatible schema
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"is_compatible": false}`

**Given** a non-existent subject
**When** I send `POST /compatibility/subjects/unknown/versions/latest`
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with Confluent error code 40401

**FRs:** FR20

### Story 4.3: Enforce All Compatibility Modes (Avro)

As a **developer**,
I want the registry to enforce all 7 compatibility modes when registering schemas,
So that incompatible schema changes are rejected automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** subject with BACKWARD mode and an existing Avro schema with a required field
**When** I register a new version that removes the required field
**Then** registration is rejected with HTTP 409 and Confluent error code 40901

**Given** subject with FORWARD mode
**When** I register a new version that adds a required field without default
**Then** registration is rejected with HTTP 409

**Given** subject with FULL mode
**When** I register a schema that is backward-compatible but not forward-compatible
**Then** registration is rejected

**Given** subject with NONE mode
**When** I register any valid schema
**Then** registration succeeds regardless of compatibility

**Given** subject with BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE mode and versions 1, 2, 3
**When** I register version 4
**Then** it must be backward-compatible with ALL previous versions (1, 2, 3), not just version 3

**Given** FORWARD_TRANSITIVE and FULL_TRANSITIVE modes
**When** registering a new version
**Then** the same transitive logic applies (checked against all versions)

**FRs:** FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30, FR31, FR32

## Epic 5: Schema Comparison

A developer can obtain semantic diffs between schemas with typed classifications and verdicts.

### Story 5.1: Pairwise Schema Diff by Subject Versions

As a **developer**,
I want to get a semantic diff between two versions of the same subject,
So that I can understand what changed between schema versions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** subject "orders-value" with versions 1 and 2
**When** I send `GET /kora/v1/subjects/orders-value/versions/1/diff/2`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with a diff containing typed changes (field added, type changed, etc.)
**And** each change includes a breaking/compatible verdict
**And** a summary with total changes, breaking count, and compatible count

**Given** a non-existent subject or version
**When** I request a diff
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 with appropriate error

**FRs:** FR33, FR36, FR37, FR38

### Story 5.2: Arbitrary Schema Comparison

As a **developer**,
I want to submit two arbitrary schemas and get a semantic diff,
So that I can compare schemas that are not yet registered.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** two valid Avro schemas
**When** I send `POST /kora/v1/schemas/compare` with `{"source": {...}, "target": {...}, "schemaType": "AVRO"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with a typed diff, verdicts, and summary

**Given** two schemas of different types
**When** I send `POST /kora/v1/schemas/compare` with mismatched types
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 with an error indicating types must match

**Given** an invalid schema in source or target
**When** I send `POST /kora/v1/schemas/compare`
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 with parse error details

**FRs:** FR34, FR36, FR37, FR38

### Story 5.3: Chain Diff Across Version Range

**When** I send `GET /kora/v1/subjects/orders-value/versions/1/diff/4?chain=true`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with per-step diffs (1→2, 2→3, 3→4) and a cumulative summary

**Given** a version range where start > end
**When** I request a chain diff
**Then** I receive HTTP 422 with an error indicating invalid range

**FRs:** FR35, FR36, FR37, FR38

## Epic 6: Operations & Packaging

An operator can control registry mode, access metrics, and deploy via Docker all-in-one.

### Story 6.1: Registry Mode Control

As an **operator**,
I want to get and set the registry mode (READWRITE, READONLY, IMPORT),
So that I can control write access during maintenance or migration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a running Kora server
**When** I send `GET /mode`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"mode": "READWRITE"}`

**Given** I want to set read-only mode
**When** I send `PUT /mode` with `{"mode": "READONLY"}`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"mode": "READONLY"}`
**And** subsequent schema registration attempts return HTTP 422 with appropriate error

**Given** IMPORT mode is set
**When** I register a schema with an explicit ID
**Then** the system accepts the provided ID instead of auto-allocating

**FRs:** FR43, FR44

### Story 6.2: Prometheus Metrics

As an **operator**,
I want to access Prometheus metrics,
So that I can monitor Kora's performance and health in my observability stack.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a running Kora server
**When** I send `GET /metrics`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with Prometheus text exposition format
**And** metrics include: request count, request duration histogram, schema count, active connections

**FRs:** FR45

### Story 6.3: Docker All-in-One Packaging

As an **operator**,
I want a Docker image that runs Kora with embedded PostgreSQL,
So that I can deploy with zero external dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Docker image is built
**When** I run `docker run -p 8080:8080 kora`
**Then** embedded PostgreSQL starts automatically
**And** Kora starts and connects to the embedded PG
**And** `GET /health` returns HTTP 200

**Given** `DATABASE_URL` is set
**When** I run `docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... kora`
**Then** embedded PostgreSQL does NOT start
**And** Kora connects to the external PG

**Given** a running container
**When** I send `docker stop`
**Then** both Kora and PG shut down gracefully via s6-overlay
